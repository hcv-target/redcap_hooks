/**
 *
 * This is a utility script that builds an array of hook functions based on a convention of using
 * @FUNCTION=PARAMS in the notes field of certain questions.
 *
 * Currently, examples include:
 *
 * @IMAGEMAP=PAINMAP_MALE
 * @MEDIAPLAYER={json parameters}
 *
 * This format is in flux...  The json is nice since you can include multiple parameters easier, but I currently don't support linefeeds and spaces, as some questions could have multiple functions...  I'll try to patch this in the future and settle on a final convention.
